    Simple route for the GitHub Actions to perform healthchecks on.

    More info is available at:

    It basically sends a GET request to the route & hopes to get a "200"
    response code. Failing to return a 200 response code just enables
    the GitHub Actions to rollback to the last version the project was
    found in a "working condition". It acts as a last line of defense in
    case something goes south.

    Additionally, it also returns a JSON response in the form of:
